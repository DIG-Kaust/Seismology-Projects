A collection of projects performed by my students in the ErSE 210 Seismology course. 

All projects have been carried out on the open [Volve dataset](https://www.equinor.com/energy/volve-data-sharing). Our ambition is to apply an extensive set of processing techniques to the dataset during the years and provide a one-stop-shop for instructors and researchers willing to use the Volve dataset for their teaching or researcher.
